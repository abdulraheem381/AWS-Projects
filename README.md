## 📌 Purpose

These projects demonstrate:

- Real AWS architectures
- Practical solutions to real-world problems
- Clean documentation, diagrams, and modular setups
- Future-ready, scalable infrastructure designs

> ⚠️ All AWS resources used during development were deleted after testing to avoid charges. The documentation includes optional steps such as domain setup and cost-aware configurations.

## 🛠 Tools Used

- AWS Console & CLI
- CloudWatch, WAF, API Gateway, Lambda, DynamoDB
- Bedrock/SageMaker, OpenSearch, Textract
- GitHub for version control and documentation

---

## 📈 Goal

This repository serves as a **DevOps + Cloud Portfolio** to demonstrate cloud architecture knowledge, deployment best practices, and the ability to solve business problems using AWS.
